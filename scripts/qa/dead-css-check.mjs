/**
 * Declarations a component makes that can never win.
 *
 * On 2 September 2026 Krish pointed at one line on `/ai-brain` sitting flush
 * against the two cards above it. The line asks for `margin-top: 30px` in
 * `.mm-payoff` and was computing 0, because `mindmake.css` carried
 * `.mm-site h1, .mm-site p, ... { margin: 0 }` at (0,1,1), and that is above
 * every single-class rule in this repository. Not "wins on order" — cannot
 * lose. Measuring the whole site found 16 more of them across five pages: the
 * fork's "No email required" flush against its buttons, the questions heading
 * with no space under it, the drum's provenance note with none above it, the
 * story outcome, the board's rebuilding line, the founder's name.
 *
 * The same shape had already cost the lead dialog its step rail's typography,
 * where `.mm-site button { font: inherit }` beat `.mm-brief-path button` and
 * the rail rendered at the body's 17px serif for months.
 *
 * A site-wide default that outranks the components it serves is not a default,
 * it is an override, and nothing in a code review shows it: both rules read
 * correctly on their own and the file that loses is not the file being read.
 * So this asks the browser instead. For every element on every page it walks
 * the author rules that match, and reports any declaration from a rule of one
 * class or less that is beaten by a `.mm-site` reset.
 *
 * The fix is `:where()`, which contributes no specificity: a reset written as
 * `:where(.mm-site) :where(p, h2, ...)` still beats the browser's own
 * stylesheet, because an author rule always does, and now loses to any
 * component that asks for something, which is the whole job of a reset.
