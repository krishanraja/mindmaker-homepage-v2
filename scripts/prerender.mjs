/* The four latin faces, preloaded.

   Measured cold on a throttled phone, the page painted at 1.06s in Helvetica
   and Georgia, then Archivo and Source Serif landed at 1.87s and reflowed the
   door copy 22px, then Newsreader landed at 2.02s and rewrapped the hero
   claim. The faces were the last thing the browser asked for, because it only
   learns about them after the 135KB render-blocking stylesheet has arrived and
   been parsed. A preload lets it ask at head-parse time, so the faces travel
   alongside the stylesheet rather than after it.

   Read from the built stylesheet rather than guessed, because Vite hashes the
   file names and the stylesheet is the one honest index of what the browser
   will request. Exactly four, or the build fails: a build that silently
   preloads nothing is the failure mode this exists to remove. `crossorigin` is
   load-bearing, because a font fetch is anonymous CORS and a preload without
   it is a second download of the same file. */

     This used to be a hand-written shell: every heading and paragraph as plain
     markup, styled to look like the first screen it was about to become. It did
     its job and it was a likeness, and three bugs came from it being a likeness
     rather than the thing. The last was a strip below the hero where the real
     page starts its next section on a raised ground and the shell had plain
     ink, which the entrance gate read as the page settling a second after it
     painted.

     Everything above this line is unchanged. `src/components/SEO.tsx` writes
     the head in an effect and so produces nothing server-side, which is why the
     title, meta, canonical and JSON-LD are still written here and why this
     replaces the body alone.

     It is `fetchpriority="high"` on its own tag and still landed 650ms after
     the plate, because the tag is only discovered once the document is parsed
     and the stylesheet is in. It is read from the rendered body rather than
     named here, so a renamed asset or a page with no priority plate cannot
     leave a stale preload behind. Only the first priority plate is taken,
     which is the hero on every page that has one; a webp preload carries its
     type so a browser without webp ignores it and takes the jpg from the
     picture element as it does today. The wordmark and the mark used to be
     preloaded here as well; they are vectors written into the page now, and
     there is nothing to fetch.

     Case-insensitive, because React writes the attribute as `srcSet` in the
     server render and this pattern was written for `srcset`: from 3 to
     4 September 2026 it matched nothing, no page carried the preload, and
     the record said every page did. `src/test/first-screen.test.ts` now runs
