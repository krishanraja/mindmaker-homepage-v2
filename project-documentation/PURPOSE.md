## Mission

Help senior business leaders become AI-literate by building working AI systems around their real work - not through vendor theatre, theoretical training, or generic demos.

---

## Vision

Create a world where business leaders can confidently integrate AI into their operations, make informed strategic decisions about AI adoption, and lead their organizations through the AI transformation with clarity and competence.

---

## Core Objectives

### 1. Build AI Literacy Through Practice
- Leaders learn by building, not by listening
- Real problems from their actual work, not case studies
- Working systems they can immediately deploy, not concepts

### 2. Cut Through AI Hype
- No vendor theatre or product pitches
- No generic "AI strategy decks" that go nowhere
- Practical implementation over theoretical frameworks

### 3. Create Lasting Capability
- AI literacy that outlives any one tool
- Frameworks for evaluating and implementing AI
- Skills to continue building independently

### 4. Meet Leaders Where They Are
- Multiple engagement models (session, sprint, lab, partnership)
- No coding required
- Flexible intensity (1 hour to 12 months)

## Anti-Goals (What We Explicitly Don't Do)

❌ Sell AI tools or platforms  
❌ Build AI for clients (we teach them to build)  
❌ Offer generic AI training or certifications  
❌ Promise ROI without doing the work  
❌ Create dependency on consultants  
❌ Replace technical teams (we empower leaders)
