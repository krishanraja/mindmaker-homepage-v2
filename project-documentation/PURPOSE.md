## Core Purpose

Mindmaker helps leaders think clearly about AI so they can make better decisions and stop wasting money on vendor theatre.

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Most leaders feel behind on AI—but don't know what to actually do about it.**

### Specific Pain Points:
1. **Can't tell what's real anymore** - 70% of AI pilots fail because execs can't separate substance from sales pitches
2. **No shared language** - Leadership teams operate from completely different mental models about AI
3. **Second-guessing every decision** - Leaders lack confidence in rooms where everyone's bluffing about AI
4. **Expensive misalignment** - Companies fund the wrong pilots because they lack frameworks to evaluate vendors

---

## How We Solve It

**We build AI literacy infrastructure that lets leaders stay sharp, skeptical, and in control.**

### Our Approach:
1. **Show them where they actually stand** - Not where they think they are (diagnostic baseline)
2. **Give them questions they'll use next week** - Real frameworks for vendor meetings, not theory
3. **Practice on their real work** - Use actual decisions as the training ground
4. **Track if they're getting sharper** - Real metrics that compound quarterly

---

## What We Are NOT

- ❌ **Not an AI training program** - We don't teach tools or technical skills
- ❌ **Not a consulting firm** - We don't build your AI strategy for you
- ❌ **Not a tech vendor** - We don't sell AI platforms or SaaS products
- ❌ **Not a workshop series** - We're infrastructure that persists, not one-time events

---

## What We ARE

- ✅ **A way to see through AI hype** and make better calls
- ✅ **Questions you'll actually use** when vendors pitch you
- ✅ **Practice infrastructure** that uses your real decisions until it clicks
- ✅ **Confidence builder** for rooms where everyone's bluffing about AI

---

## Mission Statement

**Enable leaders to think clearly about AI without relying on vendors, consultants, or hype cycles.**

We believe:
- Most AI advice is theatre designed to sell tools
- Leaders need cognitive frameworks, not more demos
- Practice on real decisions beats abstract training
- AI literacy should compound like interest, not fade like workshops

---

## Vision (3-Year)

**Become the default cognitive infrastructure for leaders navigating AI decisions.**

By 2028:
- 10,000+ leaders using Mindmaker diagnostic as their AI thinking baseline
- 500+ executive teams aligned on shared AI literacy frameworks
- 50+ investment firms using Mindmaker to de-risk portfolio AI spend
- Industry recognition as the anti-hype voice in AI leadership

---

## Core Values

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - Plain English, real talk, no jargon unless necessary
2. **Practice Over Theory** - Real decisions beat case studies every time
3. **Skepticism Over Hype** - We help you spot bullshit, not sell it
4. **Infrastructure Over Events** - Systems that persist and compound, not one-off workshops
5. **Empathy Over Judgment** - Everyone feels behind—we meet leaders where they are

---

## Success Metrics

**We succeed when:**
- Leaders can confidently challenge AI vendor claims in meetings
- Executive teams operate from shared mental models (not fragmented thinking)
- Companies stop funding pilots that were doomed from the start
- Leaders make faster AI decisions without second-guessing themselves
- Investment firms catch bad AI bets before they scale

---

## Founder Philosophy (Krish)

*"Most leaders don't need another AI demo. They need a way to think clearly when everyone's trying to sell them something."*

Krish's background:
- 16+ years building product strategy and commercial systems
- 90+ AI product strategies delivered
- 50+ executive seminars on AI literacy
- Former VP at venture-backed SaaS companies
- Witnessed countless failed AI pilots due to cognitive gaps, not technical issues

His insight: **AI literacy is the bottleneck, not AI capability.**
