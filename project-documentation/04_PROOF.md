# Mindmake brand and testimonial proof

Last updated: 7 September 2026. Proof permissions approved 2026-08-11; career-reference set extended by Krish 2026-08-27; the thirty-three revised by Krish 2026-09-07.

This file is the single project source for attendee brands, client outcomes, Steph Darmanin's consent-gated excerpts, and named career references. Other project documents must point here rather than copy these lists. The rendered data lives in `src/data/rebuildProof.ts` and must match this file.

## The thirty-three, and the two rules that hold them

Added 28 August 2026. Every testimonial the practice holds now lives in
`src/data/testimonials.ts`, in four families that never mix: five session
attendees, four named clients with consent on record, fourteen anonymised client
outcomes, ten named career references. A session attendee is not a client and a
career reference is not an AI-era outcome; the cards carry the label that says
which, and `src/test/testimonials.test.ts` checks the counts.

**Quotes are never edited.** Not for spelling, not for house style, not to
remove the founder's name. The rules that govern our own voice stop at the
quotation mark, which is why that file sits outside the copy gates and says so
at the exclusion. An earlier version of this data had been anglicised and
name-stripped to pass those gates, and a quote edited to fit a style guide is
not a quote.

**A shortened quote is an exact substring.** Thirty-three quotes of wildly
different lengths cannot share a rail, and the alternative to an excerpt is a
paraphrase attributed to a named person. Every excerpt is checked against its
full text by a test, so a rewrite cannot pass as an extract.

Both rules earned their keep on 7 September 2026. Krish revised the thirty-three
to what people actually wrote, and ten excerpts stopped being substrings of the
quotes they came from: two by a capital letter, eight because the excerpt had
been rewritten to say what the new quote meant. The test caught all ten and
every excerpt was cut again from the revised text. The story deck's eight
pull-quotes are a separate, older approval and were not revised; see the open
item in `06_CURRENT_STATE.md`.

**Named clients, consent-gated.** Steph Darmanin and Dipti Divekar are named
clients with recorded consent, which crosses the "client outcomes stay
anonymous" rule above. The exception is narrow and mechanical: a client in the
`client` family renders only where `consent` reads `recorded`, and
`publishableTestimonials` drops any that does not. A named client without
consent is dropped rather than anonymised, because an anonymised version of a
quote somebody gave under their own name is a different quote.

## Public framing

Use this headline:

> Mindmake has helped leaders across media, software and advisory with what's next in AI.

The earlier "over 4000 leaders" count is retired from public copy under the claim control in `01_CANON.md`: a count returns only when the section 6 evidence trail is compiled and Krish approves it.

Use this line immediately above the brand grid:

> Attended by people from organisations including

The organisations below are attendance proof. They are not Mindmake advisory clients and must never be described as clients.

## Approved attendee brands, exactly 16

1. Walmart
2. PepsiCo
3. P&G
4. BMW
5. Boeing
6. Pfizer
7. Visa
8. American Express
9. Goldman Sachs
10. Deloitte
11. PwC
12. L'Oréal
13. Adidas
14. BBC
15. Hearst
16. Condé Nast

All 16 organisations remain approved attendance proof. They are not all required on the homepage.

## Current homepage logo selection

Use the media organisations from the approved list for the current homepage direction:

1. BBC
2. Hearst
3. Condé Nast

Use official logo artwork in a compact one-line strip. The strip may move gently when that helps the page, but must pause for reduced-motion users and must not make the organisations look like advisory clients. Do not link the logos.

## Verified client outcome stories, exactly 8

The words in quotation marks are verbatim. Keep each client anonymous at role and sector unless a later consent record explicitly changes that. The internal engagement records behind these stories are in `04_PROOF_RECORDS.md`.

### 1. Settle the expensive decision

One day to a clear build-or-partner decision, avoiding roughly a year of engineering on the wrong path.

> “One day. One decision. No more Monday debates. That's the entire review.”
>
> CRO, media company

### 2. Turn expertise into something clients can buy

A respected advisory firm moved from ideas to a clear offer clients could buy and launched a defined investment plan.

> “We had expertise everyone respected and nothing they could buy. He turned the talking into something sellable.”
>
> Partner, Venture Capital Firm

### 3. Make the product simple enough to sell

Positioning and pricing were rebuilt in 30 days. The first two pilots were signed during the work.

> “We had a brilliant product nobody could buy, because nobody could explain it. Now they can. Including me.”
>
> Founder, adtech firm

### 4. Rebuild the business, then hand it back

An eight-week rebuild covered brand, offers, lead capture, content and outreach. Five videos shipped in week one.

> “He uses deep knowledge of AI and tech to help me with genuinely human problems. I had an AI mentor before and they were far too technical. He thinks about me and the results I need.”
>
> Founder and CEO, executive coaching practice

### 5. Own the system instead of renting the operator

A founder-owned content system cut research-backed publishing from days to under an hour. Publishing moved from roughly monthly to most days.

> “I've learnt to push through barriers I didn't know I could, and the systems make me more effective and more motivated. I used to post once a month, now it's most days. It's helping my customers see me.”
>
> Founder, research and content brand

### 6. Change how the team decides

A publisher moved from 14 competing AI vendors to three decisions, then shipped the chosen workflow with its own team and no new hires.

> “We started with immersive AI sessions, which led to a broader project where our team took ownership and accountability. He led it and landed it.”
>
> Head of Operations, top-10 US digital publisher

### 7. Tie every AI choice back to the business

Eleven of fourteen tools were stopped, the budget was defended and the first working system went live inside 90 days.

> “It's been a good journey to bring him problems that match our business goals and leadership needs, and watch them come together in a very thoughtful programme.”
>
> President, legacy broadcast business

### 8. Change direction before the market moves

A data company changed how it sold as AI changed the web. The work led to a paid test with a major US publisher.

> “He set up an AI-native go-to-market system that made us rethink who we hire and what they do. He works experimentally yet transparently. We trusted he would deliver.”
>
> CRO, data-infrastructure company

## Steph Darmanin, consent-gated named proof

Steph Darmanin is a separate client from the anonymous executive coaching practice above. Her use is approved, but the site must still fail closed against the existing Legacy Ascend consent record. If that record is absent, private, unavailable or errors, show none of these excerpts and do not show her name.

Place the excerpts where they support the surrounding message. Never group all of them together.

### Ownership after Mindmake leaves

> “What's unique about Krish is that he never lets you become reliant on him. He puts you in the driver's seat, explains AI fundamentals in plain language, and empowers you to own the skills that actually move your business forward.”
>
> Steph Darmanin, Performance Coach

### Contrast with old outsourced support

> “I have invested thousands before that resulted in terribly disappointing outcomes. The website support came to a halt once the paid engagement ended and ultimately I had to pull the plug and start over. With Mindmaker, I was empowered to own the skills.”
>
> Steph Darmanin, Performance Coach

(The word "Mindmaker" inside this quote is her verbatim wording from the time and stays unchanged.)

### On value for money

> “In 10 years of group and private mentorships, this has been the most valuable investment I have made in myself and my business.”
>
> Steph Darmanin, Performance Coach

### Beside the rebuild story

> “By week 4, I realised I was overdelivering for clients with less effort, and that clarity led me to create new offers with tiered pricing that accurately reflects the value of the service I provide.”
>
> Steph Darmanin, Performance Coach

## Approved named career references, exactly 9

These are career references. They are not Mindmake client outcomes. Use them only after client proof or on the operator/about surface. The source is the professional recommendation set Krish supplied; the three references added on 27 August 2026 (Rob Hudson, Michael Ricciardone, Marie-Anne Leung Kam) were selected by Krish for their communication and human-approach themes and condensed faithfully from that set.

### Lizzie Young

Chief Executive, Commercial Radio & Audio

> “A respected senior leader with deep expertise in digital media and data, a great communicator of complexity, with a warm nature that brings people together.”

### Rob Hudson

National Sales Director, Media, REA Group

> “A unique ability to make data products accessible to everyone in the room, not just the digital people. A genuine passion for helping clients solve business problems, and above all very personable and approachable.”

### Michael Ricciardone

Country Manager, ANZ, MoEngage

> “Articulate, engaging and entertaining. He breaks down the barriers marketers face with data and technology using relevant examples and stories, then presents clear solutions. Full of support, always keen to educate.”

### Melinda Heffernan

Ad Channel Partnerships Director APAC, Taboola

> “He explains complex technical set-ups simply and is a true problem solver. I learnt a huge amount about finding solutions for clients from him.”

### Chris Spencer

Lead Account Executive, Enterprise, Culture Amp

> “An industry expert who turns knowledge into actionable plans and crafted solutions for clients.”

### Ashley Wales-Brown

Digital Commerce Director, Mars United Commerce

> “Intelligent and hardworking, with a deep understanding of data and tech, always good for a straight answer and willing to get his hands dirty.”

### Matt Paine

Managing Partner, Lamington Digital

> “Adept at translating complex scenarios into simple, easy-to-grasp language that moves the conversation forward.”

### Marie-Anne Leung Kam

Director, 2 Square Talent

> “An outstanding leader with a clear vision, a collaborative approach and a knack for driving innovation. I could not recommend him more highly.”

### Vincent Pelillo

Regional Managing Director, Channel Factory

> “Outstanding leadership, consistently driving results in a challenging market. Where 'get it done' is valued, I'd rehire him 100%.”

## Homepage proof stack

## Guardrails

- Do not use attendee brands to redefine the advisory customer.
- Do not call an attendee organisation a client.
- Do not turn a career reference into a client result.
- Do not invent names, numbers, brands or outcomes.
- Keep approved quotation text verbatim.
- Public framing around quotes must use short, common words.
- No public count of leaders helped until the evidence trail is compiled and approved.
