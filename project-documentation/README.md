## Key Terminology

**Consistent terms used throughout documentation:**

- **AI Literacy** - The ability to think clearly about AI, separate hype from value, and make informed decisions
- **Cognitive Infrastructure** - Internal term (not customer-facing) for mental frameworks that persist and compound
- **Diagnostic** - 2-5 minute assessment that maps current thinking patterns (not a quiz)
- **Baseline** - Where a leader/team actually stands vs where they think they stand
- **Practice Infrastructure** - Continuous improvement system, not one-time training
- **Mental Models** - Internal term for frameworks that guide decision-making
- **Vendor Theatre** - AI pitches that prioritize demos over substance
- **Decision Velocity** - Speed and confidence in making AI-related strategic decisions

---

## File Update Protocol

When updating any documentation file:

1. **Update the "Last Updated" date** at the top of the file
2. **Add entry to HISTORY.md** if the change is significant
3. **Check for terminology consistency** across all files
4. **Update related files** if changes affect multiple areas
5. **Validate against DECISIONS_LOG.md** to ensure alignment with prior decisions

---

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this folder follows these standards:

- **Tone:** Technical, concise, instruction-led

- **Formatting:** Markdown with consistent styling
- **Examples:** Real examples from the codebase, not hypotheticals
