## Phase 1: Initial Build (Week 1-2)

**Original Positioning:** "Strategic AI Implementation"
- Generic enterprise transformation messaging
- 4-phase methodology: DISCOVER → DESIGN → DEPLOY → DELIVER
- Inflated statistics (100+ enterprises, 3-5x growth claims)
- Solid white cards blocking content visibility

**Tech Decisions:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite stack
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI component library
- Supabase backend integration

## Phase 2: Brand Transformation (Week 3-4)

**Repositioning:** "AI Literacy & Strategic Advisory"
- Authentic track record: 90+ strategies, 50+ seminars, 16 years
- New methodology: LEARN → DECIDE → ALIGN → SELL
- Glass morphism design system implemented
- Translucent cards with backdrop-blur effects

**Key Changes:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` documented transformation
- `DIAGNOSIS.md` captured opaque card crisis resolution
- Design system guide created for consistency

## Phase 3: Holistic Repositioning (Week 5-6)

**Final Positioning:** AI Literacy Infrastructure
- Removed all "training program" language
- Plain English throughout (no cognitive jargon)
- Simplified pathways: Foundation → Performance
- Individual Leaders + Executive Teams + Investment Firms

**Major Deletions:**
- Removed `PathwaysSection.tsx` (old modular system)
- Removed `CollapsibleMethodologySection.tsx` (gamified language)
- Removed `MethodologySection.tsx` (duplicate)
- Removed `CoachSection.tsx` (hype language)
- Removed `Coaching.tsx` page (wrong positioning)

**Tone Shift:**
- Academic → Conversational
- "Cognitive infrastructure" → "Think clearly about AI"
- "Mental models" → "Ways of thinking"
- Theory → Real-world outcomes
