## Major Decisions

### 2025-11-24: Two-Color System
**Decision:** Use only Ink + Mint (no gradients, no multi-color)  
**Rationale:** Simplicity, boldness, memorability  
**Result:** Faster design, stronger brand identity

### 2025-11-24: Authorization Holds
**Decision:** Use Stripe authorization holds, not charges  
**Rationale:** Lower barrier, refundable, professional  
**Result:** Better conversion, lower risk perception

### 2025-11-23: No User Auth Yet
**Decision:** Defer authentication implementation  
**Rationale:** All bookings via Calendly, no user content yet  
**Result:** Faster MVP, simpler architecture

### 2025-11-23: Edge Functions Over API Routes
**Decision:** Use Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)  
**Rationale:** Serverless, auto-scaling, integrated with Lovable  
**Result:** Zero server management, fast deployment

## Recurring Patterns

### Development Cycle
```
1. Design mockup/wireframe
2. Build component in isolation
3. Integrate with page
4. Test on mobile
5. Deploy + verify
6. Iterate based on feedback
```

### Decision Framework
```
1. What problem does this solve?
2. What's the simplest solution?
3. Can we defer complexity?
4. What are we learning?
5. Ship and iterate.
