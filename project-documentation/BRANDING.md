## Brand Voice

**Core Tone:** Direct, empathetic, anti-hype

- Real-world focused (outcomes over theory)
- Skeptical (question vendor claims)
- Empathetic (acknowledge leaders feel behind)
- Confident (but not arrogant)

## Messaging Principles

### 1. Empathy First
**Do:** "Most leaders feel behind on AI—but don't know what to actually do about it."
**Don't:** "Leaders are unprepared for the AI revolution."

### 2. Plain English
**Do:** "See where you actually stand"
**Don't:** "Map your cognitive baseline and mental models"

### 3. Anti-Hype
**Do:** "Stop wasting money on vendor theatre"
**Don't:** "Unlock AI's transformative potential"

### 4. Real Outcomes
**Do:** "Make AI decisions 3x faster"
**Don't:** "Accelerate your AI journey"

## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines
- Start with user pain or desire
- Use active voice
- Keep under 10 words
- Avoid buzzwords (transformation, revolution, unlock)

### Body Copy
- Short sentences (15-20 words max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use contractions (you're, don't, we're)
- Real examples over abstract concepts

### CTAs
- Action-oriented and specific
- Clear outcome expectation
- Remove friction language
- Example: "Get Your Baseline" not "Submit Form"

## Terminology Standards

**Use These Terms:**
- AI literacy (not AI transformation)
- Think clearly (not cognitive infrastructure)
- Make better decisions (not optimize decision velocity)
- Spot bullshit (not identify vendor theatre)
- Practice on real work (not experiential learning)

**Avoid These Terms:**
- Cognitive scaffolding (too academic)
- Mental models (internal use only)
- Transformation/revolution (hype language)
- Journey/roadmap (overused)
- Unlock/unleash/accelerate (vendor speak)

## Brand Personality

**Mindmaker is:**
- The skeptical advisor who tells you the truth
- The friend who cuts through BS
- The coach who makes you practice, not just learn
- The infrastructure that persists, not fades

**Mindmaker is NOT:**
- The hype-man selling dreams
- The academic lecturing with jargon
- The consultant doing work for you
- The vendor with products to sell
