## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines
- **Start with outcome** - "Build 3-5 AI systems in 30 days"
- **Be specific** - "60 minutes" not "quick session"
- **Use verbs** - "Build", "Deploy", "Learn", not "Transformation"
- **Avoid buzzwords** - No "synergy", "paradigm", "holistic"

### Body Copy
- **Short sentences** - 15-20 words max
- **Active voice** - "You build systems" not "Systems are built"
- **Concrete examples** - "Save 10 hours/week" not "Increase efficiency"
- **Second person** - "You", "Your", not "One" or "Organizations"

### CTAs
- **Action-oriented** - "Book Your Session" not "Learn More"
- **Value-focused** - "Reserve My Spot" not "Submit"
- **Specific** - "Book Your Initial Consult" not "Get Started"
