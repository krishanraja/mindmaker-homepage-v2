/**
 * The pages, rendered to HTML at build time.
 *
 * The site used to ship a hand-written shell: every heading and paragraph as
 * plain markup, styled to look like the first screen it was about to become. It
 * did its job, and it was a likeness. Three separate bugs came from it being a
 * likeness rather than the thing, the last of which was a strip below the hero
 * where the real page starts its next section on a raised ground and the shell
 * had plain ink, measured as the page settling a second after it painted.
 *
 * This renders the components instead, so first paint is the page. What the
 * shell was for is unchanged and better served: a crawler that runs nothing
 * still gets every word, and now in the real layout.
 *
 * The head is not rendered here. `src/components/SEO.tsx` writes title, meta,
 * canonical and JSON-LD in an effect, so it produces nothing server-side, and
 * `scripts/prerender.mjs` already writes all of it into the template. This
 * replaces the body only, which is why no head extraction is needed.
 */

   `scripts/prerender.mjs` emits; `src/test/ssg-routes.test.ts` holds the two
   together, in the same shape as the existing prerender-and-sitemap check. */

            is the glitch this work exists to remove, and it was invisible

            `src/test/ssg-hydration.test.ts` renders both sides and compares
