/**
 * Every testimonial the practice holds, verbatim.
 *
 * Two rules govern this file and a test enforces both.
 *
 * `full` is exactly what the person wrote. Not corrected, not anglicised, not
 * shortened, and not stripped of the founder's name. You cannot honestly quote
 * someone and also edit their spelling, so the house style rules that govern
 * the site's own voice stop at the quotation mark.
 *
 * `excerpt` is an exact substring of `full`. It exists because 33 quotes of
 * wildly different lengths cannot sit on one rail, and because the alternative
 * to an excerpt is a paraphrase, which is a quote that is no longer true. The
 * rail shows the excerpt; the full quote is one tap away.
 *
 * Four families, kept apart so they cannot be misread as one another. A session
 * attendee is not a client. A career reference is not an AI-era outcome.
