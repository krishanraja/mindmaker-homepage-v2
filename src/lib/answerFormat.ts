/**
 * The answer file format, and everything derived from one.
 *
 * `/answers` is the machine-first surface: one page per question a buyer asks,
 * written to be fetched, read and quoted by an assistant as much as by a
 * person. A page is a markdown file in `src/content/answers/`, and dropping a
 * file in that directory is the whole publishing step. There is no manifest to
 * keep in step, because a manifest is a second list and a second list drifts.
 *
 * This module has no imports on purpose. `src/lib/answers.ts` reads the files
 * through `import.meta.glob` for the site, and `scripts/lib/answers-loader.mjs`
 * compiles this same file with esbuild and reads them with `node:fs` for the
 * sitemap, `llms.txt`, the social plates and the prerender, exactly as
 * `scripts/lib/blog-posts-loader.mjs` does for the blog archive. One parser,
 * one sort order, one piece of structured data, whichever side is asking.
 *
 * The front matter is a deliberately small subset of YAML rather than a
 * dependency: single-line scalars, a list of scalars, and a list of q/a pairs.
 * Anything else throws, naming the file and the line, because a page that
 * publishes with a silently missing answer is worse than a build that stops.
 *
 *   ---
 *   title: ...

 *   answer: ...
 *   claim: ...

 *   published_at: 2026-09-05
 *   first_party:
 *     - ...
 *   faq:
 *     - q: ...
 *       a: ...
 *   ---
 *
 * `answer` is the liftable two or three sentence reply, and it renders before
 * any preamble on the page for the same reason it is a field rather than the
 * first paragraph of the body: a retriever reads the first chunk and stops.
 * `claim` is the one thing this page says that the pages already answering the
 * question do not.
