 * The published answer pages, read straight from the directory.
 *
 * `import.meta.glob` with `eager` resolves at build time, so adding a markdown
 * file to `src/content/answers/` is the whole publishing step: no manifest, no
 * import list, nothing to forget. Vite inlines the sources into the bundle, so
 * this works identically in the browser, in the server render the prerender
 * runs, and in the test suite.
 *
 * The path is written out in full rather than built from a variable, because
 * the glob is analysed statically and a computed pattern matches nothing.
