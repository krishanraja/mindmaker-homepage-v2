/**
 * The words the design was already saying.
 *
 * This gate exists because of a specific reading of the built site, on a phone,
 * on 2 September 2026: the pages were legible, passed every layout and motion
 * gate, and still read as walls. The cause was not any one long paragraph. It
 * was three habits, each of which had crept in one sentence at a time.
 *
 *  - A paragraph that congratulates the copy above it. "That is the whole
 *    idea." sat under a claim on the homepage and told the reader nothing.
 *  - An instruction printed under a control that already looks like itself.
 *    "Drag it, or use the arrows." under a drum with two arrows on it; "Pick
 *    one and this line tells you where you land." under two buttons.
 *  - The same sentence said two and three times on one page. `/ai-brain` ran
 *    "The system, the automations and the record of your standards" as an
 *    answer, then as a second answer, then as the close block's body.
 *
 * All three are cheap to write and invisible in review, so they are checked
 * mechanically here rather than trusted to taste. This reads the server render
 * rather than the source, so a code comment explaining a rule cannot trip it
 * and a string that never reaches a page cannot either.
