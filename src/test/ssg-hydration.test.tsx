/**
 * The two trees, held to each other.
 *
 * `scripts/prerender.mjs` renders every indexed page with `src/entry-server.tsx`
 * and the browser hydrates that markup with `src/App.tsx`. They are two files
 * describing one tree, and React compares them node by node: anything present
 * in one and not the other is not a cosmetic difference, it is a hydration
 * failure, and a hydration failure throws the entire server render away and
 * rebuilds the page from nothing on the client.
 *
 * Two of those shipped in one afternoon, and neither was visible in a console.
 * React's production build reports them as `Minified React error #418`, and the
 * page still ends up correct, so the only symptom is the site arriving and then
 * being replaced a second later — the exact defect the prerender exists to fix.
 *
 *  - `next-themes` inlined a `<script>` through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The
 *    client bundle and the SSR bundle minified that script's source
 *    differently, so the text never matched. Nothing read the theme, so the
 *    provider is gone; `src/App.tsx` carries the reasoning.
 *  - `App` wrapped its routes in `<Suspense>` and the server entry did not.
 *    React writes a pair of comment nodes around a Suspense boundary and looks
 *    for them again at hydration, so the client's tree opened with a marker the
 *    server had never written.
 *
 * Comparing the rendered strings is the only check that catches both, because
 * neither is visible in the markup a person would think to look at.
